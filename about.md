<p>I am currently in the deep learning platform team at Uber mainly working on [Horovod][https://github.com/horovod/horovod]
and Michelangelo platform. I enjoy reading and learning more about scalable deep learning. 

Prior to Uber, I was a Machine Learning engineer at Capital One Data Intelligence group. We used deep learning for generating synthetic data that can be used for testing and training. I also worked on training platform, hyper-paramter tuning and model lineage tracking tools for machine learning models.

I got my PhD in Computer Science from UIUC under [Prof. Marco Caccamo][http://cs.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mcaccamo] and my BSc in Electrical Engineering from [University of Tehran][https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en].</p>
